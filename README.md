# PageRankBenchmark

This repository is a fork which contains a variety of parallelized Julia implementations
of the [PageRank Pipeline Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01876).

The `other` folder contains the implementations in other languages from the original
repository (including the reference Julia implementation).
